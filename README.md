Features: What makes your project stand out? 
We have trained our agency in the new format of HTML, the HTML5, which includes a large update on the use of semantics. Instead of overusing the <div> tags, we are now able to give more appropriate tag names to our html and therein creating better understanding of what the document is about and how it is structure. Not only does this allow other developers to efforlessly follow the structure and format of the code, but more importantly these semantics can better relate to searh engines and thus optimize results for users. 
We are most excited in how accessible this has made our websites. Both for developers and users. Computer language has the capacity to be closer to human language than we have ever imagined, we plan to take full advantage of such developments to allow people of all alter-abilities, socio-ecoomic restrictions and backgrounds to have access to our sites. 

We have ensured that all links are functioning correctly, polished up the CSS and also consolidated the CSS selectors and properites. This has made the overall code more organized and much easier to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements. 

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS.
